Expedition 03bis Redux - Cartographers
======================================

This file is >> AlsoInProgress << and supervised by Polo & Nada.
It is playable for the most part but perhaps not yet 100% functional.
However, a majority of the rewards will be accessible from your other saves.

We're working on it.

*** This is a Special Edition ***
-------------
This expedition Cartographers 03 Redux is a bit special. This is the second time HelloGames has re-released it. It allows you to obtain some of the most exciting and popular rewards from the 3 previous expeditions: the Jetpack Bubble Trail, Feasting Casque, Exotic Wingpack, Streamlined Jetpack, and the legendary Golden Vector starship.

Lore
-----
2023 : Awaken stranded on the fiery planet of Coul Major, and deeply explore its surface as you work to repair your bespoke starship. This Cartographers presents some of the most exciting and popular rewards from previous expeditions: the Jetpack Bubble Trail, Feasting Casque, Exotic Wingpack, Streamlined Jetpack, and the legendary Golden Vector starship.

Cartographers is focused primarily on deep exploration of a single planet. This season places all expeditioners on the toxic world of Gisto Major, where their bespoke starship will require specialist attention to repair and launch into space.

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)

Notes
------
Some expeditions start with tech in inventory slots. You need to move them.
If you need Polo to show you Atlas stations, he won't do it UNLESS you also ask him to show you black holes. Then you will see both on your galaxy map.
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, your game will likely crash when you load it. Just close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.

Bug 
---
None recorded to date. Let me know if you have one :p

How do you do it?

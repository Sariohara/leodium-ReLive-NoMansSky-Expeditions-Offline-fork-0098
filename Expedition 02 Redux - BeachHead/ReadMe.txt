Expedition 02 Redux - BeachHead
===============================

This file is approved by Polo & Nada.
It is playable & 100% functional.
All rewards will be accessible from your other saves.
You can see from the screenshots above [EndOfDebugExp(xxx).jpg] that I'm 100% finished with this expedition.

Have a good game ...

Tip
-----
If it's been scanned with your freighter's scan, it's considered as just "re-visited" and not as "discovered for the 1st time when you land".
I don't think I could do anything about that ... So you have to be careful ...

Lore
-----
Crossover event with Mass Effect, awarding the SSV Normandy SR1

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
Added the ability to activate expedition via the Nexus desktop

Notes
------
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, the expedition will abruptly end. Just quickly close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.

Bug ?
---
- No other bugs have been reported to date. Let me know if you have one :pm

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".

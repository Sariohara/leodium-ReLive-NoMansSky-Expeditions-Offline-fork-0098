===============================

This file is approved by Polo & Nada.
It is playable & 100% functional.
All rewards will be accessible from your other saves.
You can see from the screenshots above [EndOfDebugExp(xxx).jpg] that I'm 100% finished with this expedition.

Have a good game ...

Tip
-----
Phase 03 Stage 02 "The Murkey Veil"
The stage is to "visit" a swampy planet and it seems that the game only considers the stage to be validated when the "swampy planet" marker is "discovered for the 1st time when you land". 
If it's been scanned with your freighter's scan, it's considered as just "re-visited" and not as "discovered for the 1st time when you land".
I don't think I could do anything about that ... So you have to be careful ...

Phase 05 Stage 03 "Acquire the Myth Beacon"
Acquiring the Myth Beacon will require 80 Quicksilver. At that stage you'll probably have only 45, and won't have access to Nexus Quicksilver missions (downside of being offline).
The easiest way to get around that is to collect more flux readings for Nada, since they reward 15 Quicksilver each. If you do 3 more, you'll have 90 Quicksilver.
Alternatively, you can enable Nexus Quicksilver missions in the save file (see https://github.com/leodium/leodium-ReLive-NoMansSky-Expeditions-Offline/discussions/5#discussioncomment-10136384)

Lore
-----
Crossover event with Mass Effect, awarding the SSV Normandy SR1

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
StartingSuitTechSlots value --> 8 (to have Tech slots available since they were mixed up with the inventory at the time)
Added the ability to activate expedition via the Nexus desktop

Notes
------
Some expeditions start with tech in inventory slots. You need to move them.
If you need Polo to show you Atlas stations, he won't do it UNLESS you also ask him to show you black holes. Then you will see both on your galaxy map.
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, your game will likely crash when you load it. Just close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.
Phase 5, milestones 4 and 5 can no longer be completed in a reasonable amount of time. The target planet seems to be on the other side of the galaxy. Due to this issue, the milestones have unfortunately been replaced so the expedition can be completed.

Bug ?

- No other bugs have been reported to date. Let me know if you have one :pm

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".

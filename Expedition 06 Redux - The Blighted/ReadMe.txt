Expedition 06 Redux - The Blighted
==================================

This file is approved by Polo & Nada.
It is playable & 100% functional.
All rewards will be accessible from your other saves.
You can see from the screenshots above [EndOfDebugExp(xxx).jpg] that I'm 100% finished with this expedition.

Have a good game ...

Lore
-----
The Blighted aligns with the piratical theme of the Outlaws release. Travellers will follow the trail of a pirate faction known as The Blight and their mysterious treasure, gathering clues and decrypting milestones.

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
Added the ability to activate expedition via the Nexus desktop

Notes
------
Some expeditions start with tech in inventory slots. You need to move them.
If you need Polo to show you Atlas stations, he won't do it UNLESS you also ask him to show you black holes. Then you will see both on your galaxy map.
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, your game will likely crash when you load it. Just close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.

Bug ?
---
None recorded to date. Let me know if you have one :p

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".

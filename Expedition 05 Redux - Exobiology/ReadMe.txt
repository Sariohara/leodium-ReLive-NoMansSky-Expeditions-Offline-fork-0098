Expedition 05 Redux - Exobiology
==================================

This file is approved by Polo & Nada.
It is playable & 100% functional.
All rewards will be accessible from your other saves.
You can see from the screenshots above [EndOfDebugExp(xxx).jpg] that I'm 100% finished with this expedition.

Have a good game ...

Lore
-----
Exobiology is focused primarily on discovering and interacting with the strange and varied alien creatures inhabiting the universe. This season places all expeditioners on a lonely star system devoid of wildlife, but with a towering bipedal creature companion to accompany them.

Changes to the SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json file
------
EndTimeUTC value --> 2893423600 (so that it can still be done today)
Added the ability to activate expedition via the Nexus desktop


Any tips or tricks? 
------
Once you've found all the eggs in step 02 of Phase 3, you'll have the Nutrient Processor plan. Once it's built, there will be a new inventory that will unlock 'only' for food. This may help you to keep only your Honey Cake visible for Chronos ....

Notes
------
Some expeditions start with tech in inventory slots. You need to move them.
If you need Polo to show you Atlas stations, he won't do it UNLESS you also ask him to show you black holes. Then you will see both on your galaxy map.
If you start your game in online mode after starting an offline expedition, your game will likely crash when you load it. Just close the game and go offline and everything should be fine.

Bug ?
---
None recorded to date. Let me know if you have one :p

How do you do it?
------------------
Simply copy/paste a file into a directory ... No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...

a) First of all, set your game software to "Offline".

b) Then, download the file "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" from the cache directory of the expedition you wish to redo.

c) Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just downloaded
-> Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
-> Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
-> MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache

d) Restart "No Man's Sky" in offline mode and start a new game "Expedition".

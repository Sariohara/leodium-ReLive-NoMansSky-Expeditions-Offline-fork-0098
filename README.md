# ReLive-NoMansSky-Expeditions-Offline 

:trophy: :man_astronaut: Replay ALL No Man's Sky Expeditions :star: :rocket: <i>with a simple copy/paste of a file into a directory ... </i>  
💾 <i>No modification/influence on saves !!! No intervention on game files ...</i>  
Available for Windows / MacOs & SteamDeck

> **The full archive can be downloaded here** : https://github.com/leodium/leodium-ReLive-NoMansSky-Expeditions-Offline/releases
    

> [!NOTE]
> A few changes may have been made to the original progression because, with successive updates from Hellogames, certain references in the game's database have changed and, as a result, we've had to adapt by sometimes modifying an intermediate mission that is no longer possible ... But don't worry: the main rewards and the original storyline have been respected.
>
> <b>Confidence : I'm in the process of redoing/revisiting (for) myself the expeditions myself to check them ... </b>  but 💾 **A Expedition Mega Save Project by** [Geldric™](https://steamcommunity.com/app/275850/discussions/0/4286936086674242135) on Steam has enabled us to check everything so far!
> 
> 🙊 I use the json files from this joint **advanced customisation module** between myself and *@cwmonkey* to enable you to adapt the difficulty of Expeditions.
(I dreamt it and he coded it masterfully) --> https://cwmonkey.github.io/nms-expeditions

> [!TIP]
> Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ... After all, we're hero explorers!

# 🚀 Why am I sharing my method?
My "ReLive-NoMansSky-All Expeditions" project is aimed at Hero Travellers who want to test themselves against the requirements of the previous No Man's Sky expeditions. I've just got into the game and I was sorry I couldn't do them, learn the mechanics of the game and get the related rewards other than by "cheating" by adding them via a mod or save editor.

So I decided to modify the Hello Games json files and adapt them for my own use ... As I saw that it was safe and that other players were asking me how I'd done it ... I decided to share my method ...

**Become Heroes riding your GoldenVector followed by the SSV Normandy and decked out with badges from previous Expeditions!**

> [!NOTE]
><i>You are now in a directory of [SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json] files, allowing you to relive past No Man's Sky Expeditions as they were when they were released. Introduced with the Expeditions update, this mode features a series of time-limited events that begin at a fixed point in the universe. This allows the community to "embark on a shared journey". Each expedition is built around a series of milestones. These objectives can be achieved in any order, allowing players to obtain specific rewards, meet other players and experiment with different ways of playing.</i>
 
# ⚙️ How do you do this?
- [x] Step 01 : Set your game software to "Offline".
<sup>(Steam and GoG have an Offline mode but prefere to cut the wifi or network after downloading the file from step 2)</sup>
- [x] Step 02 : Download the "SEASON_DATA_CACHE.json" file from the cache directory of the Expedition you want to redo.
- [x] Step 03 : Replace the file in your [cache] directory with the one you've just uploaded

> - 👉🏻 Steam PC : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
> - 👉🏻 Steam Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/HelloGames/NMS/cache
> - 👉🏻 MS Store/GOG : %APPDATA%\HelloGames\NMS\cache
> - 👉🏻 SteamDeck : /home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/275850/pfx/drive_c/Users/SteamUser/AppData/Roaming/HelloGames/NMS/cache
 
- [x] Step 04 : Restart "No Man's Sky" in Offline mode.

> [!TIP]
><i>The expedition json file has no interaction with the 'classic' game saves. And it is not overwritten by anything: OnLine or OffLine, unless you replace it yourself or HelloGames releases a new expedition. Only these two cases can cause a "problem".
>In these specific and unique cases, when you resume your current expedition, it will be explained to you that it stops where you are and that it will be transformed into a "classic game" in the same way as when you "normally" end an expedition. The solution is therefore not to enter the expedition save mode and to save the json file corresponding to your current expedition while remaining OffLine if it is the HelloGames expedition that has appeared.
>
>In fact, for the files in my project, being Online or Offline makes no difference. But I prefer to ask everyone to be OffLine to avoid the problem of the shipping json file being overwritten by a HelloGames update ...</i>

# 📎 Details
- Modification of the access period so that you can access it whenever you want, with no time limit.
- Progression through the stages preserved so that rewards can only be obtained when the objectives have been reached in order to earn them ...
- Changed the number of Tech slots in the exosuit to correct the fact that, at the start, the technologies were in the normal inventory (so remember to move/replace them at the start of the Expedition if necessary).
- Here is the directory of the **REDUX versions of Expeditions**. I've opted for the Redux versions because they're more recent and less likely to have bugs as a result of updates made by HelloGames since their release. 
- The directory [SeasonDataCacheAllOriginalFiles] contains the original HelloGames json files without any intervention on my part.
